# Digit Recognition Neural Network in Java

A simple feedforward neural network implementation in Java that recognizes handwritten digits using hardcoded data. This project serves as an introduction to implementing and training neural networks for image classification tasks.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Feedforward Neural Network:**
  - Input layer, single hidden layer, and output layer.
  - Implements forward propagation, backward propagation, and training.
  
- **Hardcoded Dataset:**
  - Includes a simplified 5x5 pixel representation of digits (0‚Äì9).
  
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Normalization of pixel values and conversion of 2D images into flattened 1D arrays.
  
- **Easy Training and Prediction:**
  - Train the network on the hardcoded dataset and test it on unseen samples.

## üìÇ Project Structure

```
/src
  |-- NeuralNetwork.java           // Core logic for the neural network
  |-- DatasetHandler.java          // Handles training data and labels
  |-- Main.java                    // Entry point to run training and prediction

## ‚ö° How It Works

### 1. **Dataset**
- A hardcoded dataset representing digits 0-9 as flattened 5√ó5 grids of pixel values.
- Labels are provided as integers corresponding to the digit in each dataset row.

### 2. **Neural Network**
- Consists of an input layer (25 neurons), a hidden layer (10 neurons), and an output layer (10 neurons for classes 0-9).
- Trained using forward propagation, loss calculation, and backward propagation.

### 3. **Prediction**
- After training, the model predicts digits for unseen samples based on the highest probability in the output layer.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DigitRecognitionJava.git
```

### 2. **Compile and Run**
1. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin Main
   ```

### 3. **Modify Data**
- You can add more data or change the `DatasetHandler` class to load data from external files for scaling purposes.

## üìú Code Examples

### **Training the Network**
```java
double[][] trainingData = DatasetHandler.loadTrainingData();
int[] labels = DatasetHandler.loadLabels();
NeuralNetwork neuralNetwork = new NeuralNetwork(25, 10, 10, 0.1);
neuralNetwork.train(trainingData, labels, 1000);
```

### **Testing the Network**
```java
double[] unseenTestSample = { /* Input digit in 5x5 format */ };
int predictedDigit = neuralNetwork.predict(unseenTestSample);
System.out.println("Predicted Digit: " + predictedDigit);
```

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Java:** Core programming language for the implementation.
- **Feedforward Neural Network:** Algorithm for digit recognition.
- **Manual Dataset Handling:** Hardcoded dataset for training and testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

- Use external datasets like **MNIST** for robust training.
- Incorporate data preprocessing and augmentation.
- Add support for saving and loading trained models.
- Expand the network to include more hidden layers or use convolutional layers for better accuracy.

```

### Key Points:
- Replace `YourUsername` in the `git clone` command with your GitHub username.
- Add a license (`LICENSE` file) if necessary, such as the MIT license.
- Include any additional notes, such as acknowledgments or additional project requirements.
